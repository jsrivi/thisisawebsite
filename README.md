I could not figure out anything interesting to write about except my cousin, so here we are. The reason I decided to write about my cousin is because he is an _interesting_ fellow. There are a number of stories I could tell about him but I am just going to talk about the most interesting two here.

### The Pissneyland Disaster

About five years ago, my cousin and my aunt came to visit us from Thailand. To celebrate the occasion, we decided to go to Disneyland. We went to a number of rides, ate foods from all the little stands, but the most memorable thing was actually waiting in line for the Toy Story Buzz Lightyear ride. About 1/4 of the way into the line, my cousin said he had to pee. My aunt did not want to get out of the line to take him to the bathroom, so she told him to just hold it in. Once we were 3/4 of the way into the line, he told his mom again that he had to pee. After being met with the same response, my cousin decided to just pull down his pants **in the middle of the line** and try to start peeing. His mom had to forcefully shove his pants back on for him to stop. And the best part was, when we were just about to actually get onto the ride, it broke down.

### "How do I use this again?"

I did not witness this scenario firsthand, but my brother explained what happened. My cousin went to the bathroom with his mom when he was young, so he would always use the women's restroom instead of the men's one. The problem is that he never really grew out of the habit. One day he was forced to use the guys restroom because he had to go with my brother instead of his mom. When they got there, my brother went to do his business but my cousin just stood in front of the urinal. After waiting there a while, he asked my brother "Can you help me use this? I have not used one of these in a while." That is the end of the story.
